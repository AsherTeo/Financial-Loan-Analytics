# Financial Loan Analysis with Dashboard (Below)

## Overview

In the initial phase of this project, we utilize a financial loan dataset to delve into insights across various features. Our objectives include determining which categorical features contribute most significantly to profitability, evaluating the impact of interest rates on profits, investigating the correlation between loan term lengths and profitability, and exploring additional factors of interest. For this analysis, we leverage SQL for data extraction, and Python equipped with the `pandas` library for data analysis, `seaborn` for data visualization, and `scikit-learn` for machine learning. Furthermore, we enhance our visualization with the interactive dashboard features of **Power BI** , providing more detailed and dynamic visualizations
