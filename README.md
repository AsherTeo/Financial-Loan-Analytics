# Financial Loan Analysis with Dashboard (Below)

## Overview

In the initial phase of this project, we utilize a financial loan dataset to delve into insights across various features. Our objectives include determining which categorical features contribute most significantly to profitability, evaluating the impact of interest rates, debt-to-income, annual income on profits, investigating correlations between these variables and profitability, and exploring additional factors of interest. For this analysis, we leverage SQL for data extraction, and Python equipped with the `pandas` library for data analysis, `seaborn` for data visualization, and `scikit-learn` for machine learning. Furthermore, we enhance our visualization with the interactive dashboard features of **Power BI** , providing more detailed and dynamic visualizations. 

Subsequently, we trained and optimized a machine learning model using feature selection techniques such as **Chi-Square** and **ANOVA**, along with `optuna` to select the best hyperparameters for the XGBoost (XGB) model. This was done to predict whether applicants will be eligible for loans in the future. The process was facilitated through a machine learning graphical user interface (GUI) provided by `gradio`, as demonstrated below
